Cheese Anti-Virus is a TROLL/FAKE anti-virus!
Let the text above be a warning as to it does NOT scan viruses and clear them.

What the installer does: installs files into a hidden folder in appdata call .HolyCheeseMan
does the "anti-virus" actually delete system32. no, it simply changes changes your primary mouse button and changes your wallpaper.

What the plugin maker does: nothing pranky, just changes the script.

Thanks for reading!
